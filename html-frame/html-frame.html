    <p class="p-body"> In the University of Maryland’s Applied Mathematics & Statistics, and Scientific Computation graduate program <a href="https://amsc.umd.edu/" target="_blank">(AMSC)</a>, third-year graduate student Brooke Herzog has sometimes gone for days without seeing another woman in the office. </p>

    <p class="p-body">“I personally have felt supported by the department. But you definitely feel sometimes, like, 'Oh, yeah, I'm the only one who's like me, sounds like me.’ And that I think always has an impact—if you feel alone or isolated. It's not as nice as it could be,” Herzog said. </p>

      </script>
      </div>
<!--Gender Breakdown Graph END-->

    <p class="p-body">Currently, a little over half of the enrolled students at College Park are male, according to the 2019 data from the <a href="https://www.usmd.edu/IRIS/" target="_blank"> Institutional Research Information System</a>. Yet, despite women making up almost half the student body, within the university’s STEM colleges, the gender-gap and overwhelming male-dominancy become blatantly obvious, according to women students’ testimonials and data provided by each department.
    <p>

    <p class="p-body">Nationally, women have outnumbered men in undergraduate education, making up over half of the total college educated workforce in the U.S., according to a 2018 study from the National Science Foundation <a href="https://nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsb20181/report/sections/higher-education-in-science-and-engineering/undergraduate-education-enrollment-and-degrees-in-the-united-states" target="_blank">(NSF)</a>. But even nationally the high male-to-female ratio in STEM majors is disheartening.
    </p>

    <p class="p-body">The 2018 NSF report states that in 2015, “Men earned the vast majority of bachelor’s degrees awarded in engineering, computer sciences, and physics and more than half of the degrees in mathematics and statistics. Women earned half or more of the bachelor’s degrees in psychology, biological sciences, agricultural sciences, and all the broad fields within social sciences except for economics.”
    </p>

    <p class="p-body">Since 2000, changes have not followed a consistent pattern, as shown by the report. The share of bachelor’s degrees awarded to women declined, particularly in computer sciences (by 10%) and in mathematics and statistics (by 5%). Agricultural sciences is the field in which the proportion of bachelor’s degrees awarded to women grew the most during this period (by 9%).

            <h5 class="sub-chapter">In pursuit of STEM...</h5>
              <p class="p-body">Born and raised on the island of Dominica, Massarueh’s personal experiences guided her decision to major in environmental science and policy with a focus on agriculture at the University of Maryland.  Dominica used to be heavily dependent on agriculture, however, environmental impacts on the agricultural community from constant hurricanes and tropical storms took its toll, and agriculture quickly dissipated as the backbone of Dominica’s economy.
              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                Because of this, Massarueh grew up experiencing moments where she did not have access to fresh food and sometimes did not have access to food at all. Moments like these are what motivated her to pursue a career in STEM. She wanted to find out ways that could provide food to those who did not have access to it—find out what policies can be put into place to help people in need, especially when they’re facing natural disasters like she has.
              </p>
<!--DOMINICA MAP-->

                  <img src="dominica-map.png" alt="map of Dominica in Caribbean" class="dominica-map"/>
                  </div>
<!--DOMINICA MAP ENDS-->
              <p class="p-body">
                Today, Massarueh has begun to live out her passions fighting against food injustice, insecurity and inequality in her local communities.
              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                She is currently working as a community farm coordinator with a Maryland organization called BeMoreAg. The organization has begun constructing greenhouses around Baltimore county for hydroponic farming to provide jobs and fresh produce to Baltimore county, as well as to inspire the youth.
              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                “Over the past four or five years, I have seen my surrounding communities face food injustice and food inequality…and the problem of food scarcity," Massarueh said. "That sort of geared my focus—to okay how can I help these people who live like 10 miles away from me but have a food desert. So that’s sort of driven me to where I am today. It’s like, how can I help people get out of situations that I have experienced personally."
              </p>
            <h5 class="sub-chapter">The STEM environment for women</h5>
              <p class="p-body">
                Being part of a professional agricultural sorority called Sigma Alpha meant that Massarueh did not feel a major student gender gap in her environmental sciences and agriculture classes.
              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                “Being an ag major, which I described myself as, there was a lot of women, but not as much as the men in the field. However, there was not a lot of black women in the field," Massarueh said. "So I will say that was like the major student gap that I could see and that I personally experienced. Being in classes filled with not as much diversity as you would think there would be, but that's just ag culture industry overall in the United States."
              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                The lack of diversity in her program pushed Massarueh to work harder.
              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                Massarueh explained, “Because, in a sense, it's sort of stated that ‘hey, I need to work differently than most of these people because when you see them you're like they belong in this field and when you see me you may not think the same.’ So I have to work twice as hard as my peers in order to meet that bar.”
              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                Networking was also a challenge for Massarueh, who said when she would finally meet people in the agriculture many of them, if not most, were white.
              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                “I had to really push myself to put myself out there because not everyone in my program looks like me,” Massarueh explained. “I had to do the extra mile to meet the same people that [white students] wanted to meet, had to join more organizations than they would have to join just to get my face out there—just to get my name out there.”
              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                Besides the lack of student ethnic diversity, especially black women, Massarueh feels that another challenge women in general face is the stereotype that “men do it all and women can’t.”
              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                “As a woman, you instantly get the remarks that you can’t do it. Like from your male professors, they come a little bit less enthusiastic towards you,” Massarueh said. “They’re more like, ‘Oh, maybe she can’t do it. Let’s see if she can do it.’ Whereas if it’s a guy, they are like ‘Here’s the job. Do this. Do that.’ You know? So you sort of sense that. They didn't directly say that to you, but you definitely get the sense that, okay, this is something that I have to like put extra work into.”
              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                However, Massarueh’s higher education career was not marred by these adversities. Massarueh said she had many positive experiences in the Agriculture and Natural Resources Department. There were many professors who fully supported and helped Massarueh along the way, whether in personal matters, academia, mentorship and overall career development.
              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                “Connecting with the other black women in the department, that was an experience that I definitely cherish,” Massarueh said.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                First, be yourself in a confident, strong and independent way. It’s about making sure that your goal and your aspirations and your community goals and aspirations are met, and that you value yourself as a woman. Always think of yourself as someone who can do it. Also, feel inspired by yourself and push yourself, because no one’s going to do that for you. You’ll have to be your motivator.
              </p>
              <p class="p-body">
                And another thing is mental health. I think it’s something very important which we have to understand and also keep in mind when we’re working. Like yes, we want to help other people. Yes, we want to be there, but we also have to take care of ourselves mentally, not just physically. I suffered from bipolar too, and I didn’t imagine myself being accomplished as I am because I deal with the ups and downs of depression and my life is sort of like a roller coaster. But by taking care of myself mentally I realized that I can accomplish anything that I set my mind to.

              Patel was not passionate about being in the marching band in high school. So when she saw a math teacher outside of his classroom desperately handing out flyers trying to attract more girls to diversify the new introduction to computer science class, she pitied him and decided to sign up.
            </p>
            <p class="p-body">
              “In the beginning I did absolutely horribly, but I really found the love of learning from my mistakes like I felt like in that space I was allowed to fail. I was allowed to fail over and over and over again,” Patel said. “It was okay that I couldn’t write the code because my teacher was just so supportive, and instead of telling me that my code wasn’t working and that it was my fault, he would tell me that it’s because I didn’t understand the concept correctly and he re-explained it to me the way that it made sense to me the most.”
            </p>
            <p class="p-body">
              Patel says she gets ultimate satisfaction from not only learning new things but also being able to expand her own mental capabilities and mathematical strengths and just explore all the venues of computer science.

            <p class="p-body">
              “It’s really what inspires me these days because just learning about all the applications in computer science, not only technical but also societal, like how the work that you do actually does impact everyday people, how different avenues of computer science basically touches every aspect of life, and how it could be used to solve causes that are near and dear to my heart,” Patel said.
            </p>
            <p class="p-body">
              “I’ve noticed that girls are more scared of taking risks when they don't know that they’re already amazing,” Patel said.
            </p>
            <p class="p-body">
              Patel explained:
                “I’ve noticed that boys especially like my cousins or like guys I’m friends with, they’re very fearless in the way that if there is a challenge that comes, and they don’t know if they’re going to be able to do it or not, they’ve been taught their whole life that they should at least go for it, “shoot the shot,” even though they miss. But girls are always more scared like ‘people are gonna judge me if I ask that question.’ ‘People are going to judge me if I don’t make the shot.’ And this goes for women in sports too, like it’s across the board in so many fields. It’s just that, especially in STEM, it’s always very subliminal. You can’t see it on the extremely surface level that like you’re being nudged away from it. It’s more underneath like once you’re there you realize that there’s been all these things that have been telling you not to do this.”
            </p>

          <h5 class="sub-chapter">The STEM environment for women</h5>
          <p class="p-body">
            Patel said she was already used to the gender gap in computer science because of her experiences throughout high school. At her high school, there was a total of four girls (including herself) who decided to pursue engineering or computer science out of a graduating class of 300 students.
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            “When I got to University of Maryland I didn’t feel at all shocked by the fact that I essentially knew all the girls in my CS class, which is hard in a CS lecture hall of like plus 200 people,” Patel said.
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            Patel said she noticed that most girls dropped out their first year, first semester, even the first class, because of a feeling of inferiority and inadequacy. Most of these girls strived for A’s and if they were not getting A’s, then they would decide that they weren’t good enough for the class anymore, Patel said.
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            Although 20% of UMD undergraduate students are women majoring in computer science, the retention is terrible with each class that follows the introductory classes. Patel said this disparity has become so obvious that both girls and guys have noticed the divide.

          “The girls in my class will text me and be like, ‘Hey, what time is your discussion? I think I can switch so I can get into your discussion or I can talk to my discussion to go to your discussion,” Patel said. “I'll ask them why and they’ll say ‘I'm the only girl. None of these guys want to talk to me or none of them want to do like the pair working with me.”

          <p class="p-body">
            These women do all the work alone and feel like they’re not getting the education they deserve.
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            Patel even had a friend, who instead of going to her 12 p.m. discussion, would show up to Patel’s discussion at 8 a.m.
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            Patel, however, says she feels she has been blessed with amazingly supportive professors. All her male professors have been very vocal in support of women in STEM and extremely inclusive for all people.
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            “And it’s not about breaking the bubble, as it is more about expanding the bubble to let more people in because it’s a very boys-only club sometimes, and that can be really hurtful as well, especially when you're trying to get your point across,” Patel said.
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
          Female students in computer science face more challenges in group settings. Patel says she has been called bossy for speaking up for having a plan and has gone through many unsolicited mansplaining lectures from her male peers.
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            In a group setting, Patel will usually wait for when her male peers are at a loss or clueless, “then that’s my place to talk but not to be the person in the beginning of the conversation to start splitting up the work because what’s my purpose in doing that?”
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            “But if a guy did it, he’s ‘the boss’, you know? ‘He’s just confident.’ ‘He just knows what to get done.’ ‘He’s in charge because he’s smart.’ While I’m ‘bossy,’” Patel said.
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            “Taking a leadership role is looked down up basically and you’re always seen as someone who is more likely to be the beta, the second-hand, the secretary role,” Patel said. “[Men] just assume that you’re like, ‘Oh, I don’t want to do the algorithm.’ Like what do you mean I don’t want to do the algorithm? I want to do the algorithm like let me do the algorithm.”

            Through the Girls Who Code club and Maryland Center for Women in Computing (MCWIC) events, among other inclusive computer science clubs, Patel has been able to develop a strong support network and by doing so has made the gender gap less daunting.

          <p class="p-body">
            “I think that the progressiveness of the CS field is to know that at the end of the day, the fact that we all have different ways of thinking, makes our material stronger. It makes the products we create more versatile,” Patel said.

              <strong>What advice would you give to younger women who are interested in pursuing this major or any other STEM major?</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="p-body">
              So in general for STEM, the key to success is learning how to fail. It's learning how to fall down over and over and over again. To let people tell you that you’re not good enough and you just turn around and keep going, and to keep pushing yourself.
            </p>
            <p class="p-body">
              Push yourself to your limit every single day, but not to your breaking point. There's difference. There's a limit and then there’s a breaking point. Don’t push yourself so much that you don’t like what you’re doing anymore, but push yourself to see how far the expanse of your brain can go like. To see how nerdy you can be.
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            Your brain has the capability to rewire itself, however, works for you, and every single girl has the potential to be a math brain. I hate when people are like, ‘I'm not that left brain.’ ‘I'm not that right brain.’ It's not like that. Everyone’s born with the capability to do both. It’s just that your whole life you’ve been told that you're not good enough for one of them, and some people do lean towards one or the other. But there’s 100% a way that you can rewire your brain to do the other thing. Hundred percent you can do it. You can fail 100 times for that one moment of success, and that is all that matters.
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            Being perfect is about being your best self, being the best version of yourself, being a positive person in the community, being someone who puts 100% into their work, who cares, who listens, who’s a good leader, who’s a good follower. It’s not about being someone who shoots and always scores, there is a complete difference.

            While the national trend for women in engineering is steadily rising, at the University of Maryland, the A. James Clark School of Engineering is still fairly male-dominate—with women making up 27% of the undergraduate enrollment in the school of engineering, according to enrollment statistics for women in the A. James Clark School of Engineering.

        <h5 class="sub-chapter">In pursuit of STEM...</h5>
          <p class="p-body">
            From a very young age, Ramos always had a thirst for knowledge and this transcends to what inspires her today in the field of mechanical engineering—creating things to help in that pursuit of knowledge.
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            Her father, Juan Ramos, works as deputy director of engineering at NASA, and he has been her role model and greatest supporter in the field of engineering, and STEM, in general. Ramos says she never felt pushed into the field by her father or swept away by the grandeur of his work at NASA, but rather had always been captivated by learning what makes things work.
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            “I love puzzles. I have a whole like shelf of just different puzzles that I have. I'm very fascinated by how things fit together. I also love pulling things apart putting them back together, like I always loved that as a child,” Ramos said.

          <p class="p-body">
            “It started off with pens and it went on to toy cars or like just building blocks. Once I got older, I was fascinated by how pianos worked and like the mechanical systems of a piano. So, definitely like all those different characteristics was like hey not only do I love all these things but it would fit so well into being an engineer, and with a role model that I have in my father, everything just kind of lined up.”
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            Ramos’s dream would be to work at NASA like her father.
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            “Growing up that's always been kind of like a goal for me. One of the things that I love about NASA is that a lot of what they do is for knowledge. It's to find out, or to discover what they don't know, to understand ideas or stuff about the universe that is not known,” Ramos said. “That's one of the things that I love not only about NASA, but like what has kind of inspired me as well is that search of knowledge, of trying to understand things or trying to find things that aren’t yet known, or at least are not common knowledge.”
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            Educating and inspiring younger children is her second passion along her trajectory in becoming a mechanical engineer.
          </p>
          <p class="p-body">
            “I still want to be an engineer, that’s my number one goal, but kids are also a passion. I not only want to inspire females and kids to go into engineering if that’s what they truly love, but also find ways to mentor them, help out and work for organizations to go and speak to kids,” Ramos said.
          </p>
        <h5 class="sub-chapter">The STEM environment for women</h5>
        <p class="p-body">
          Having women be the vast minority in most classes, and especially discussion groups, is not a problem for Ramos, but because the majority are “white and entitled,” she has frequently been belittled by her male peers.
        </p>
        <p class="p-body">
          “I've had bad experiences of where I have been paired up with some of them, and they just zoom through things. Don't include me. Don't ask for my help. And it's like sh**. I'm here for reason. I'm smart,” Ramos said. “Am I a genius to where I can get these calculations done in a second? No. But can I still get this done? Do I still know my sh**? Yeah. You don’t need to treat me like sh** just because I’m a female and you don’t think I’m up to par to where you are. It’s very frustrating.”
        </p>
        <p class="p-body">
          Fighting against the feeling of inferiority is a challenge for almost all women at the school of engineering, Ramos said. Especially in group settings, Ramos feels like she can’t completely speak her mind and she doesn’t have a voice or that she shouldn’t have a voice and should just stay quiet “while the boys talk it out.”
        </p>
        <p class="p-body">
          “And it’s like, no, I have valid ideas. I should be able to speak and have my input be valid and not just brushed away,” Ramos said. “I’m just feeling like you’re not heard or given as much of an opportunity to speak because, of course, the majority of people in that room are male. Regardless of whether they’re older or they’re like my college-level...it's always leaning towards them.”
        </p>
        <p class="p-body">
          Ramos has faced a situation where she approached a  professor after an exam review to ask a couple of questions that her and her group of friends were confused about, and the professor was entirely dismissive towards her, when he had just previously been explaining things to other male students who had approached him before her.
        </p>
        <p class="p-body">
          “He literally looked at me like I was stupid like I had asked the stupidest question in the world,” Ramos said. “I was like, ‘I don’t know how you went from point A to point C where the answer is. I’m trying to find some gap. And he’s like, ‘Well, I don’t know how else you want me to explain it to you.’ I'm like, ‘Could you maybe repeat it?’ He responded with, ‘Well, I was pretty clear.’”
        </p>
        <p class="p-body">
          Ramos went on to find out that many other female students had similar issues with this professor as well. Despite this professor, Ramos believes the department as a whole is very supportive.

          “Thankfully, I don’t know if I’ve been lucky but I’ve had some really, really nice professors, and I will definitely name them. One of them is Keystone Instructor Jarred Young. And the other is Keystone Instructor Michael Galczynski,” Ramos said.
        </p>
        <p class="p-body">
          Ramos feels that both professors are very personable to their students and empower them to grow whether in the engineering field or in their own personal lives. The environment they have created is welcoming and dynamic.
        </p>
        <p class="p-body">
          “These specific male professors I appreciate so much like I’ve been to their office hours. I’ve had conversations with them helping me out and just giving me great advice and telling me to keep pushing through. And they’re just absolutely amazing professors,” Ramos said.
        </p>
        <p class="p-body">
          “So those are the two positives that whenever I get into like a bad situation with a professor or a student, I think not everyone is horrible out there like I've had great experiences,” Ramos said.

            <p class="p-body" style="color: white">
              Firstly, create a good support system. I say support <em>system</em> because it can come in various different ways. For me, my family is definitely part of that big support system. But a support system is people who encourage you. People who, regardless if you’re feeling really down or not, they give you that love and words of encouragement to help you keep going and to help you push through those bad moments.
            </p>
            <p class="p-body" style="color: white">
              Whether that’s a professor you got along with really well, a group of close friends who are in the same major as you, so through your common collective experiences you guys can really help each other through it. Having that support system helps you get through it because it is really tough to get through engineering. It’s not an easy major.
            </p>
            <p class="p-body" style="color: white">
              To the young women who are going into STEM, I would first say you are incredible. I am so proud of you for being able to go into that STEM field and kicking its butt, because it’s hard.
            </p>
            <p class="p-body" style="color: white">
              It’s hard, but keep in mind your passions. Keep in mind what made you choose this in the first place. Because you’re gonna have classes at first that you don’t like. You’re gonna have professors and peers that will make you want to quit. But at the end of the day, it’s being able to get through those bad experiences and those rough classes that make it worth it.
            </p>
            <p class="p-body" style="color: white">
              Find that one class that you absolutely enjoy, that one professor that helps you. Find something you can channel all of your passion through and that’ll keep you pushing through it. Because you’re not gonna love everything about starting engineering, but at the end of the day you have to get through it to be able to reach your goal.
