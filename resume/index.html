<p> I am a dedicated journalist who has worn various hats to get a story done and published. Facets of my work and student experiences required me to be an editor, copyeditor, proofreader, reporter, social media savant and technical writer. I flourish with multimedia projects, and I am keen on creative audio and visual storytelling.

        <h5>Jan. 2019—Dec. 2019</h5>
          <p>I edited staff reporters’ articles for content, spelling, grammar, AP style and clarity. I worked together with reporters to pull together factual, yet conversational articles, including writing headlines. Every two weeks I would provide at least 3-4 story pitches for the Nutrition and Food section of The Campus Trainer.</p>

I was responsible for producing and publishing Instagram posts/stories 2-4 times a week, sometimes creating simple infographics. I also engaged with UMD students and faculty at various events to foster interest and encourage sustainable practices.</p>

    <h3>Editorial and communications intern</h3>
      <h4>National Education Association</h4>
        <h5>Jan. 2017—Aug. 2017</h5>
          <p>I wrote articles for online NEA Today news and other NEA Today print publications; proofread, researched, and fact-checked articles for NEAToday.org. I drafted and edited press releases for NEA’s public relations team and actively participated in weekly editorial meetings.</p>

    <h3>Public relations intern</h3>
      <h4>Humane Society of United States</h4>
        <h5>Nov. 2016—Jan. 2016</h5>
